In order to get the HTTP chapter to work, after installing the ngf-server make sure to do a ng build otherwise will get an error that it can't find some index.html file in the dist folder
http://localhost:8808/api/events
if still not working, try to run cmd as admin and make sure the proxy.conf.json has localhost spelled correctly

for login use
username:johnpapa
password anything is ok
